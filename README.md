ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repo Exists

This repository is designed **especially for learning Git and understanding how Git works in combination with ML projects**. It includes:

- Step-by-step **Git version control practice** (commits, branches, merges)
- Machine Learning scripts/notebooks to practice ML workflows
- Sample datasets and experiment logs
- Practical coding exercises to build ML intuition

ðŸ“š Whatâ€™s Inside

- `notebooks/` â€“ Jupyter notebooks exploring ML algorithms, experiments, and results  
- `data/` â€“ Sample datasets used in notebooks and practice  
- `scripts/` â€“ Python files for data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation  
- `README.md` â€“ This overview, explaining the structure and purpose

ðŸš€ Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Harry086/ml_learning.git
   cd ml_learning

2.Create a virtual environment:

bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate       # on macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate          # on Windows

3.Install dependencies:

bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

4.Open and run notebooks:

bash
jupyter notebook
